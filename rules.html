        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          Your goal is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to
          create a tile with the number 2048.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rule">
        <h2>Starting the Game</h2>
        <p>
          The game begins with two tiles already in the grid, having a value of
          either 2 or 4, and another such tile appears in a random empty space
          after each turn.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rule">
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they
            are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid.
          </li>
          <li>
            If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will
            merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that
            collided.
          </li>
          <li>
            The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same
            move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rule">
        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>
          The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rule">
        <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide
            together, only the two tiles farthest along the direction of motion
            will combine.
          </li>
          <li>
            If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the
            same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the
            first two and last two.
          </li>
          <li>
            A scoreboard on the upper-right keeps track of the user's score. The
            user's score starts at zero, and is increased whenever two tiles
            combine, by the value of the new tile.
          </li>
        </ul>
